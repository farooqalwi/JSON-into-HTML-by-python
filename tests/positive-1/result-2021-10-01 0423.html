                                <p><strong>Pavel Durov commented the reason for blocking the Smart Voting bot<br><br></strong>On his official <a href="https://t.me/durov/168">Telegram channel</a>, Pavel posted an article about why Telegram had to follow the Apple and Google policies when they suspended a voting app.<br><br><em>"Telegram gives its users more freedom than any other app. If Telegram has to temporarily remove some content due to a law, it means that other platforms would have removed it long before us."</em>, — Pavel Durov wrote in his post.</p>

                                <p><strong>Why was it crucial to publish the September Telegram update as soon as possible<br><br></strong>The most important thing in this update is hidden under the hood. Earlier, Telegram used the "int32" value storage system (it has been since the launch of the application in 2013), where the range of user IDs, bots, groups and channels is already ending. In this regard, new users would simply lose the opportunity to register in the messenger, and the old ones would lose the opportunity to create groups, channels and bots.<br><br>Starting <a href="https://t.me/tginfoen/1262">with the 8.1 update</a>, a fundamental restructuring of all storage systems and scripts to "int64" has been done, providing for the expansion of this range. That is why the developers wanted to update Telegram as soon as possible, thus minimizing the risks.</p>
