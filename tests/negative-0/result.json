Mukhtar was captured and sent to gallows by the Italians.\n\nOmar al-Mukhtar's famous dying words in 1931 after the rope he was hung with broke: Italy is as weak as its ropes. His executioners were Italian Fascists who met an ignominious end, while Mukhtar's legacy lives on.\n\nOmar is remembered as the Qur'an teacher who led by example and fought the occupiers to the death. Less known is that he was also a Sufi, and a humanist who abided by the Medina ethical code of war unlike his Fascist opponents.\n\nOmar al-Mukhtar's status as a high symbol of resistance is a result of his absolute refusal to abandon his cause despite his old age and numerous attempts to bribe him. His view was: We don't belong in Italy, and Italy doesn't belong here."
