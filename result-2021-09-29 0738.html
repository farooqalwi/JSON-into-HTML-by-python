                                    <p>Hafiz Mohammed Abdul Karim (d.1909) — The Munshi (language teacher) was an Indian attendant of Queen Victoria (d.1901). He served her during the final fourteen years of her reign, gaining her maternal affection over that time. She would take him on her travels and he taught her Urdu. Abdul Karim was one of two Indians who arrived in Britain to attend the Queen at the Royal Household. 

He was met with hostility by her attendants and immediate family.

Following Victoria's death in 1901, her successor, Edward VII (d.1910), returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi's correspondence with Victoria.</p>

A Bedouin of the desert visited the Prophet’s tomb and greeted the Prophet, addressing him directly as if he were alive. “Peace upon you, Messenger of God!” Then he said, “I heard the word of God ‘If, when they had wronged themselves . . .,’ I came to you seeking pardon for my mistakes, longing for your intercession with our Lord!” The Bedouin then recited a poem in praise of the Prophet and departed. The person who witnessed the story says that he fell asleep, and in a dream he saw the Prophet saying to him, “O ‘Utbi, rejoin our brother the Bedouin and announce [to] him the good news that God has pardoned him!”</p>

                                    <p>Omar al-Mukhtar led the resistance against Italy's colonial drive to occupy modern-day Libya. The savage struggle saw Italy deploy chemical weapons, and concentration camps. Mukhtar was captured and sent to gallows by the Italians.

Omar al-Mukhtar's famous dying words in 1931 after the rope he was hung with broke: Italy is as weak as its ropes. His executioners were Italian Fascists who met an ignominious end, while Mukhtar's legacy lives on.

Omar is remembered as the Qur'an teacher who led by example and fought the occupiers to the death. Less known is that he was also a Sufi, and a humanist who abided by the Medina ethical code of war unlike his Fascist opponents.

Omar al-Mukhtar's status as a high symbol of resistance is a result of his absolute refusal to abandon his cause despite his old age and numerous attempts to bribe him. His view was: We don't belong in Italy, and Italy doesn't belong here.</p>

                                    <p>Today marks the 90th anniversary of the martyrdom Omar al-Mukhtar (d.1931): The Lion of the Desert. Omar was an Islamic scholar and revolutionary who heroically led the resistance against the Italian occupation of Libya for almost 20 years. 

He was captured on September 11, 1931, after his horse was shot and fell to the ground in a clash near Ain el-Louf area. On September 15 of the same year, a mock trial was conducted for al-Mukhtar before being executed on September 16, 1931, in Suluq town, south of Benghazi.

May God have mercy on his soul.</p>
